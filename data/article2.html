<p><em>CSS is a hard language to maintain. It’s funny because CSS seems like an easy or simple language at first because of the abstraction of more complex specificities of other languages, like the scope of the variables, the absence of functions, etc... but it’s specifically this lack of more complex properties that makes CSS harder to write it a clean way that will be easy to manage as the project change and expand.</em></p>

<p><em>In this article, I’ll talk about recent methodologies that were created to make CSS management and coding a lot easier.</em></p>

<h3>When the cascades become a lake</h3>

<p>A couple of months ago, I did some research about methodologies to write CSS and have a better organization of my CSS files. I realized that as the projects I was working on became bigger, it became harder to keep everything clean and that’s when I found out about methodologies like BEM, OOCSS, ITCSS, SMACSS, etc…</p>

<p>All these methodologies have something really particular in common : they avoid cascading stylesheets. Yup, you read correctly. Actually, cascading is a pretty bad idea for large-scale projects. It blocks the modularity of your code since all your classes will be related on their parent classes. When using cascading, it makes your code more susceptible of getting bad surprises, because the specificity of your elements become harder and harder to guess as you create more classes. Let me explain.</p>

<p>As you probably already know, CSS is based on specificity of the DOM components. Various selectors you can use to apply styling to components have different levels of specificity. Basically, it breaks down like this :<p>

<ul>
<li>Inline style attributes  = 1000</li>
<li>IDs = 100</li>
<li>Classes, pseudo-classes, attributes = 10</li>
<li>Elements = 1</li>
</ul>

<p>If you start to use multiple types of selectors, your CSS will quickly become a mess, and you will loose track of which CSS styles will win over another. That’s why all these methodologies recommend to use only classes. That way, you will avoid a lot of confusion down the road.</p>


<h3>Nomenclature</h3>

<p>All the methodologies mentioned earlier propose their own nomenclature or use BEM. Personally, I use BEM.</p>

<p>BEM is short for Block-Elements-Modifiers.</p>

<p>A <strong>block</strong> is a component of your page (ex: header).<br>
An <strong>element</strong> is an element (duh!) of your block (ex: a ‘li’ of your header).<br>
A <strong>modifier</strong> is a class suffix you add to your block or your element to specify a change of state to it (ex: the li of your header is active).</p>

<p><strong>A couple of rules : </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>All the BEM class names should always be lowercase and use dashes to separate words if necessary.</li>	
	<li>The class names of your DOM components should always start with the block name. The element and modifier name are always appended to the block’s name that they are within.</li>
	<li>If it`s an element, it should be separated from the block`s name with two underscores: blockname__elementname.</li>
	<li>If it’s a modifier, it should be separated of the block or element`s name with two dashes. Example : blockname__elementname--modifiername.</li>
	<li>NEVER use an element within another element. Let's say you have a link within an item within a navbar. The link class should be something like 'navbar__link', not 'navbar__item__link'.</li>
	<li>When writing the HTML, if you’re using a modifier, always put the class name without the modifier too, like this : <p data-height='101' data-theme-id='0' data-slug-hash='vXERkj' data-default-tab='html' data-user='maximecote' data-embed-version='2' class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/maximecote/pen/vXERkj/'>BEM nomenclature example</a> by Maxime Cote (<a href='http://codepen.io/maximecote'>@maximecote</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src='//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js'></script>
This is because the DOM component should use BOTH the default component CSS properties, plus the modifier’s properties.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits of using a preprocessor</h3>

<p>When I wasn’t using this methodologies and was just mirroring the HTML in my stylesheets, the benefits of using a processor were great because normal CSS doesn’t allow classes within classes. So I could write code like this :</p>

<p data-height='306' data-theme-id='0' data-slug-hash='WGbzEV' data-default-tab='css' data-user='maximecote' data-embed-version='2' class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/maximecote/pen/WGbzEV/'>LESS writing old-school</a> by Maxime Cote (<a href='http://codepen.io/maximecote'>@maximecote</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src='//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js'></script>

<p>At the time, I thought it was great. But when using non-cascading stylesheets, the use for this was non-existent now that I was using only 1 level of specificity. But I discovered something quite useful. You can still use the cascading for your class names only and not the specificity. Like this:</p>

<p data-height='258' data-theme-id='0' data-slug-hash='RGNrpJ' data-default-tab='css' data-user='maximecote' data-embed-version='2' class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/maximecote/pen/RGNrpJ/'>RGNrpJ</a> by Maxime Cote (<a href='http://codepen.io/maximecote'>@maximecote</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src='//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js'></script>

<p>This is really helpful to keep your LESS files well organized and to avoid code repetition.</p>


<h3>Keeping your files organized</h3>

<p>All the methodologies mentioned propose their own file organization system, but they are all really similar. The one that I prefer the most is ITCSS so that’s the one I’ll talk about, but I suggest watching YouTube videos of each ones and decide which one you think you'll like the most, as it's mostly a question of personal preferences.</p>

<p>ITCSS stand for Inverted Triangle CSS. Basically, it helps organize your files so that the files you include in your project go from most generic to most precise. It goes like this (please note that I changed a bit the organization of the files to fit my needs, the accurate ITCSS infos are there if you’re interested : <a target='_blank' href='https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/'>https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture</a>).</p>

<div class='header-text'>
<h5>Config</h5>
Fonts imports and each types of variables (breakpoints, colors, etc).
</div>

<div class='header-text'>
<h5>Tools</h5>
Mixins and functions you might want to use. I don’t use that one that much.
</div>

<div class='header-text'>
<h5>Generic</h5>
Default selectors styling, reset files, normalize files.
</div>

<div class='header-text'>
<h5>Objects</h5>
Basic components with no particular styling. Objects can be moved around from one project to another since they don’t have particular styling. Example: a list of inline-block items.
</div>

<div class='header-text'>
<h5>Components</h5>
This is where most of the styling is done. 
</div>

<div class='header-text'>
<h5>Utilities</h5>
Here you can create helpers class (like Bootstrap’s ‘pull-left’). This is also where I override CSS libraries if necessary, because libraries will mostly use specificity and I want most of my stylesheets to avoid specificity. 
</div>

<p>You also create a main file outside of these folders, which will include all the necessary files in the correct order. You need to include your files in the same order as the folder listed above.</p> 

<p>It’s important to realize that since we don’t use cascading styles/specificity anymore, the priority of the styling is done by the order of the files you include. A file included later on will override the styles applied to a DOM component who could be targeted at two places.This shouldn’t happen often if you follow the guidelines correctly, but it still can. A good example would be if you add something like font-size to your h1 in a file in your generic folder, but then you add again the font-size to a h1 using a class in the components. But this is all normal, and you shouldn’t encounter any issues, because the more important styling is done in the components folder, not in the generic folder.</p>


<h3>Using libraries/toolkits</h3>

<p>One of the main issues I encountered using this methodology is that I still wanted to use Bootstrap, because I like some of their components and their grid system. After a while, I can say that I don’t recommend using 3rd-party libraries if you’re doing a lot of custom styling. As the goal of these methodologies is to have cleaner and more maintainable code, it’s kind of counter-productive to use 3rd-party libraries. It’s really a matter of deciding either you want really clean code that will be longer to code, or less clean code that will be faster and probably easier to code.</p>

<p>But if you do decide to keep using libs, here’s some guidelines I followed when using a combination of ITCSS and Bootstrap :</p>

<ul>
<li>When writing the class of HTML of DOM components, always put your own class before the Bootstrap classes.</li>

<li>As Bootstrap is using specificity, you will probably need to use it too to override the styling. You should do so in the Utilities folder, so that you always keep the specificity uses at the end of your stylesheets. I also suggest to use the LESS ampersand operator to specify the Bootstrap component you are styling should be in which of your components, to avoid overriding all the uses of the Bootstrap component, if necessary.</li>

<li>If you only want to use your classes but still want to use Bootstrap, there’s still a way to do it, but I personally don’t recommend it. You could use LESS extend operator, so that you extend Bootstrap classes in your own classes. It would make cleaner HTML, but the CSS would messier and also much bigger since you're duplicating a lot of code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What about Javascript ?</h3>

<p>When writing Javascript, you also use selectors to target your element. You should avoid using the same classes for both styling and your javascript. What I suggest to do is keep using classes for your Javascript, but always use classes starting with the ‘js-’ prefix. This way your Javascript and your CSS become independant and you don’t risk breaking anything when modifying your code.</p>

<p>So the order of the classes when you write HTML components should be : classes-custom classes-lib classes-js, like this :</p>

<p data-height='114' data-theme-id='0' data-slug-hash='dpPmVd' data-default-tab='html' data-user='maximecote' data-embed-version='2' class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/maximecote/pen/dpPmVd/'>BEM with js example</a> by Maxime Cote (<a href='http://codepen.io/maximecote'>@maximecote</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I’ve been using all of the techniques mentioned in the articles only for a couple of months, so what I’ve been saying is really more of an introduction to the subject then a bulletproof guide. Unfortunately, documentation on this subject is still obscure and there is not a lot of ressources on it. I think the best way to learn it is to use it, and experiment with it. Analyse what you’re doing, find out what works best, find solutions to DRY, and surely you’ll come up with a solution that will make the styling of your projects much more simple. I know that it helped me a lot, and that now adding components to a page or updating current components take a fraction of time that it used to take.</p>
