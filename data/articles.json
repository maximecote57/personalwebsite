I don't have a lot of experience compared to other web developers writing blogs; I've been in the field for about 3 years. But these 3 years have been pretty intense. Web development is a field that you need to be passionate about if you want to excel in it. There's so much going on that it can be hard to keep track of everything. There's consistently new frameworks/libraries/toolkits/workflows coming out, so you really need to see everything from a generic point-of-view, instead of trying to learn every one of them. I strongly believe that web developers (and programmers in general) should focus on a few technologies instead of trying to touch a bit of everything, and this is probably one point that will come out often in my articles. I have a lot of ideas of stuff to write about, hopefully I'll be able to find the time needed to write them. The website is still under development too, so it should become better and have more features as time goes by. Hope you find the articles interesting ! Max"}
